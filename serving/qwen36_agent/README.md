# serving/qwen36_agent

Production-oriented Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4 serving example for long-running agent
sessions.

This directory is the **policy layer** above the FlashRT execution contract. It
owns automatic exact-prefix reuse, OpenAI-compatible tool calling, streaming,
and request scheduling. It must not add session or KV verbs to
`exec/`; the contract remains Buffer / Graph / Plan / Event / ShapeKey.

The execution-state **capsule** feature (cold-prefill a shared prefix once, then
restore instead of re-prefill on later turns) is documented in
[`capsules.md`](capsules.md); this server exposes hot-state prefix reuse, and
the capsule API lives on the frontend.

## Quickstart (end-to-end, reproducible)

**Prerequisites**

- A CUDA GPU (developed on RTX 5090, sm_120) and the FlashRT runtime built/installed
  (`pip install -e ".[torch]"`, then the CMake build — see the repo `docs/INSTALL.md`).
- The Qwen3.6 NVFP4 checkpoint directory (the model weights) and, for speculative
  decode, the MTP checkpoint. Point the server at the NVFP4 directory.
- Server-only Python deps: `pip install fastapi uvicorn`.

**1. Start the server**

```bash
export FLASHRT_QWEN36_MTP_CKPT_DIR=/path/to/qwen36_mtp_ckpt
export FLASHRT_QWEN36_LONG_KV_CACHE=fp8

python -m serving.qwen36_agent.server \
  --checkpoint /path/to/qwen36_nvfp4 \
  --model-name qwen36-27b \
  --max-seq 32768 \
  --route-min-seq 0 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
# startup loads the model, then logs: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Do not set `FLASHRT_QWEN36_TQ_VERIFY_GRAPH=1` or
`FLASHRT_QWEN36_TQ_MTP_CHAIN_GRAPH=1` for normal agent serving. The server
defaults those graph flags to `0` on SM120 so arbitrary growing sessions avoid
request-time exact-position graph capture. Enable them only for fixed-shape
graph-replay benchmarks.

**2. Check it is up**

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health      # model, max_seq, live sessions
```

**3. A chat completion (OpenAI-compatible)**

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "qwen36-27b",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Python one-liner to reverse a string."}],
  "max_tokens": 128
}'
```

The response is an OpenAI `chat.completion` with an extra `flashrt` block of serving
telemetry (see [Response fields](#response-fields)).

**4. Streaming (Server-Sent Events)**

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "model": "qwen36-27b", "stream": true,
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain a hash map in two sentences."}],
  "max_tokens": 128
}'
# emits `data: {chat.completion.chunk}` lines, then `data: [DONE]`
```

Tokens are streamed only after they are committed to the session state (committed
decode), so the visible transcript never runs ahead of the GPU state.

## Design target

- 256K context on the existing Qwen3.6 long-context FP8-KV/TQ kernel path.
- Latency-first, single-stream hot session by default.
- Automatic exact token-prefix reuse for OpenAI-compatible coding-agent turns:
  cold prefill once, then only prefill appended user/tool/diff/log tokens. A
  FlashRT session id is an optional native hint, not a protocol requirement.
- Direct long-decode kernel launch by default for live agent sessions, so a
  growing conversation does not pay exact-position CUDA Graph capture in the
  first real request. Fixed-shape graph replay remains opt-in for demos and
  benchmarks.
- True SSE streaming at speculative-decode accept boundaries.
- Streamed tokens are session-committed tokens only. The old stateless
  full-generate shortcut of over-verifying and trimming output is forbidden in
  this host because it would leave hidden KV state ahead of the client-visible
  transcript.
- OpenAI-compatible tool calls without leaking partial `<tool_call>` JSON.
- Interfaces that can later grow into paged/offloaded KV, batched decode, or
  multi-GPU routing without changing the `exec` contract.

## v1 cache policy

The first backend is contiguous and hot-state-first because that matches the
current fastest Qwen3.6 single-stream kernel path. A request can reuse the hot
frontend state when its tokenized prompt exactly extends the cached prefix. This
does not require a client-provided session id: OpenAI-compatible clients that
resend full history are matched by token/content prefix. `flashrt_session_id`
remains a native hint for explicit affinity, not the primary compatibility path.

For OpenAI-style clients that resend full visible history, the service also
tracks the visible message journal. If the token journal contains hidden
Qwen-only tokens that the client does not resend, the service recognizes the
message-list append and prefills only the serialized suffix after the previous
assistant turn. Divergent prompts rebuild or restore at a future checkpoint
boundary. Truncation also rebuilds in v1: the frontend cannot roll the hot GPU
state back to a shorter prefix until checkpoint/rollback support lands.

For OpenAI-style clients that resend the full message list every turn, prefix
reuse requires the history to include the assistant content/tool call emitted by
the previous response. If a client sends only the new user/tool message without
the assistant turn, the token stream has diverged and the server must rebuild or
restore from a checkpoint.

This intentionally differs from paged/block serving frameworks: those are good
for high-concurrency batch serving, but the first FlashRT agent target is one
interactive long session on a consumer GPU.

## Implementation phases

1. CPU-only meta validation for prefix planning and tool-call streaming.
2. Split Qwen3.6 frontend generation into prefill and spec-decode steps.
3. Add the FastAPI host that maps OpenAI requests to session-aware generation.
4. Add checkpoint/rollback and eviction policy.
5. Benchmark: cold 128K/200K/256K plus incremental 2K/8K/16K turns.

## Current backend gate

`Qwen36FrontendAgentEngine` is wired to the real Qwen3.6 frontend for the
short-context committed split:

- cold short prefill: `prefill_own_speculative_nvfp4_agent`
- hot contiguous short append: `append_own_speculative_nvfp4_agent`
- cold long prefill: `prefill_long_ctx_nvfp4_agent`
- hot contiguous long append: `append_long_ctx_nvfp4_agent`
- committed streaming decode:
  `decode_own_speculative_nvfp4_committed_stream` or
  `decode_long_ctx_nvfp4_committed_stream`

Long-context append-prefill is limited to the currently hot contiguous frontend
state. Requests without `flashrt_session_id` can still attach to that hot state
when their tokenized OpenAI history is an exact extension. Non-hot prompts still
rebuild/restore at the policy layer rather than reporting a fake cache hit.
Exact same-length prompts continue from the current hot boundary; shorter
prompts rebuild until rollback/checkpoint support lands.

## Server parameters

`python -m serving.qwen36_agent.server [flags]`:

| flag | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--checkpoint` | (required) | Qwen3.6 NVFP4 checkpoint directory |
| `--model-name` | `qwen36-27b` | id reported by `/v1/models` and echoed in responses |
| `--device` | `cuda` | torch device |
| `--max-seq` | `262208` | max sequence length (prompt + generation) |
| `--route-min-seq` | `0` | min prompt length sent to the chunked long-context FP8-KV path; `0` routes even short real prompts there to avoid request-time per-position graph capture |
| `--graph-cache-max` | auto | per-cache CUDA-graph LRU bound for opt-in exact graph replay; the production agent default uses direct long-decode kernels instead of exact-position decode graphs |
| `--warmup-preset` | `none` | startup warmup shapes: `none` / `agent` / `short` / `long` / `all`; production agent serving does not need graph warmup by default |
| `--warmup` | `""` | extra warmup shapes, comma-separated `prompt_len:max_tokens` |
| `--warmup-K` | `6` | speculative K used during warmup |
| `--warmup-committed-max-prompt` | `1024` | run real committed-stream warmup up to this prompt length; larger long-context shapes use graph-only warmup |
| `--warm-long-prefill-graphs` | off | also capture long-context prefill chunk graphs at startup |
| `--capsule-budget-mb` | `0` | GPU byte budget (MB) for pinned shared-prefix capsules; `0` disables pinning. See [Capsule pinning](#capsule-pinning-shared-prefix-reuse-for-non-hot-requests). |
| `--default-max-tokens` | `2048` | generated-token budget used when a request omits both `max_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` |
| `--max-output-tokens` | `8192` | hard generated-token cap; requests above this return HTTP 400 instead of being silently truncated |
| `--default-session-id` | unset | legacy fallback session id for older single-client demos; normal OpenAI-compatible clients should rely on automatic hot-prefix reuse instead |
| `--host` / `--port` | `127.0.0.1` / `8000` | bind address |
| `--log-level` | `info` | uvicorn log level |
| `--access-log` | off | enable uvicorn per-request access logs; off by default to avoid benchmark jitter |

Capsule pin/restore in this server is a production long-route feature. If a
request supplies `flashrt_pin_prefix`, the server requires a positive capsule
budget plus the long FP8-KV route (`--route-min-seq 0` and a long-context
`--max-seq`). It fails fast instead of silently falling back to the legacy short
prefill path.

Startup warmup is optional. The production agent default avoids exact-position
decode graphs on the live path, so arbitrary coding-agent sessions do not need
minutes of synthetic warmup. Use `--warmup-preset agent/all` only when you are
intentionally preparing fixed-shape graph-replay demos or benchmarks.

If startup warmup is enabled, logs print every queued warmup shape and then a
`startup warmup done i/N` line as each shape finishes. Per-request logs use the
same metric fields for both buffered and streaming responses:

```text
complete | sid=... | act=message_append | tok p=  9251 cache=  9237 new=   22 out= 384 | ms prefill=   13.0 ttft=  146.0 decode= 3278.4 | speed decode= 117.1 tok/s | finish=stop | tools=0 | lookahead=0 | hot=... | K=6
stream   | sid=... | act=message_append | tok p=  3110 cache=  3089 new=   31 out= 512 | ms prefill=   12.8 ttft=   72.7 decode= 4316.9 | speed decode= 118.6 tok/s | stream= 4418.5ms/ 115.9 tok/s | finish=stop | tools=0 | lookahead=0 | hot=... | K=6
```

For streaming responses, `decode_tok/s` measures backend decode-active time;
`stream_wall_tok/s` includes SSE/client backpressure and is the user-visible
streaming wall-time rate.

On SM120, the server defaults to the optimized decode kernels used by the
benchmark path (`FLASHRT_QWEN36_DECODE_FASTGEMM=1` and
`FLASHRT_QWEN36_VERIFY_WARPSPLIT=1`). It also defaults
`FLASHRT_QWEN36_TQ_VERIFY_GRAPH=0` and
`FLASHRT_QWEN36_TQ_MTP_CHAIN_GRAPH=0` for agent serving, because exact-position
decode graphs are keyed by the live `cur_pos` and hurt first-use latency in a
continually growing session. Set those graph flags to `1` before startup only
for fixed-shape warmed benchmark runs. `/health` reports the kernel flags.

## HTTP surface and request fields

OpenAI-compatible: `GET /v1/models`, `GET /health`, `POST /v1/chat/completions`,
`POST /v1/sessions`, `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}`. Standard OpenAI request fields
(`messages`, `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens`, `stream`, `tools`) plus
FlashRT extensions:

If neither `max_tokens` nor `max_completion_tokens` is supplied, the agent
server defaults to 2048 generated tokens so coding-agent tool turns are not cut
off by a chat-sized output cap. Production deployments should set
`--default-max-tokens` for their client mix and keep `--max-output-tokens` as a
hard safety bound; oversized requests fail with HTTP 400 instead of being
silently shortened.

If `prompt_tokens + max_tokens` would exceed `--max-seq`, the server clips the
generated-token budget to the remaining context for that request. If the prompt
itself leaves no room for at least one generated token, the request is rejected
before streaming begins.

- `prompt_cache_key`: OpenAI-style namespace hint for routing/reuse policy.
- `cache_salt`: vLLM-style namespace separator; lower priority than
  `prompt_cache_key`.
- `flashrt_session_id` (or `session_id`): optional native session-affinity hint.
- `flashrt_cache_salt`: legacy FlashRT namespace separator.
- `flashrt_K`: speculative decode K for this request (default 6).
- `enable_thinking`: passed to the Qwen chat template (default false).
- `flashrt_pin_prefix`: pin this request's shared prefix as a capsule for reuse —
  an integer (pin that many leading prompt tokens) or `true` (pin the whole
  prompt's chunk-aligned head). Inert unless the server was started with
  `--capsule-budget-mb > 0`. See [Capsule pinning](#capsule-pinning-shared-prefix-reuse-for-non-hot-requests).

OpenAI-compatible clients do not need to pass FlashRT extension fields for the
normal single hot conversation path. The server tokenizes the full resent
history and automatically attaches it to the hot prefix when it is an exact
extension. `--default-session-id` is kept only as a single-client compatibility
fallback for older local demos.

## Response fields

On top of the standard `chat.completion` (`choices[].message`, `usage`), each
response carries a `flashrt` telemetry block:

| field | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `session_id` | the session this request used |
| `cached_tokens` | prompt tokens reused from the hot session (the prefix-reuse win) |
| `new_prefill_tokens` | prompt tokens actually prefilled this turn |
| `prefill_ms` | prefill / append time |
| `first_delta_ms` | time to first emitted delta (TTFT-like) |
| `decode_ms`, `decode_tok_per_s` | decode time and throughput |
| `prefix_action` | how the session was reused: `exact` / `append` / `message_append` / `restore` / `pin` / `truncate` / `rebuild` / `activate_rebuild` |

The standard `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` mirrors the FlashRT
cached-token count so OpenAI-compatible tools can observe prefix-cache hits
without reading the `flashrt` extension block.

## Measured (RTX 5090, in-container)

Single RTX 5090 (sm_120), `qwen36_nvfp4` (25 GB) + MTP, `--route-min-seq 0`,
FP8-KV. Numbers are the serving path (real `/v1/chat/completions`), measured to
substantiate the two design claims below; this is not a throughput-serving
benchmark (single stream, latency-first).

**1. Automatic hot-prefix reuse keeps prefill flat as a conversation grows.** A
4-turn coding-agent session (full history resent each turn; session id optional):

| turn | `prefix_action` | `cached_tokens` | `new_prefill_tokens` | `prefill_ms` |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | append (cold) | 0 | 352 | 14.5 |
| 2 | message_append | 416 | 23 | 12.4 |
| 3 | message_append | 503 | 22 | 12.7 |
| 4 | message_append | 589 | 20 | 12.5 |

Each turn prefills only the ~20 new tokens and reuses the growing cached prefix
(416 → 589), so prefill stays ~12 ms instead of growing with the transcript. A
server without prefix reuse re-prefills the full prompt every turn (589 tokens on
turn 4). This is the `append` / `message_append` path; correctness is gated
token-exact by `tests/test_qwen36_agent_gpu_split.py`.

> **Honest scope of contiguous append.** The committed stream stops at the
> visible stop-token boundary, so the hot session remains reusable when the next
> OpenAI request resends the prior assistant/tool turn. If a client rewrites or
> omits prior visible history, the token stream is no longer append-only and the
> server rebuilds or restores from a capsule instead of reporting a fake hit.

**2. Capsule restore replaces a shared-prefix cold prefill with a flat copy.**
Snapshot a shared prefix once, then restore + append the new suffix instead of
re-prefilling it (see [`capsules.md`](capsules.md) for the API and the full
table). Long FP8-KV route, chunk-aligned prefix, cold vs capsule TTFT:

| shared prefix | cold TTFT | capsule TTFT | speedup | token-exact |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 2048 | 259.6 ms | 111.0 ms | 2.3x | yes |
| 4096 | 358.5 ms | 46.5 ms | 7.7x | yes |
| 8192 | 775.6 ms | 111.0 ms | 7.0x | yes |

Cold TTFT grows with prefix length; capsule restore is a bandwidth-bound copy and
stays roughly flat, so the gap widens with the shared-prefix length a coding
agent resends each turn. Validated token-exact in
`tests/test_qwen36_agent_capsule.py`.

### Honest framing vs vLLM / SGLang (prefix reuse is *not* our differentiator)

Shared-prefix reuse itself is table stakes — vLLM and SGLang both have it, and
vLLM's Automatic Prefix Caching even reuses this hybrid model's GDN/mamba state
("Mamba cache mode = align"). Measured on the same checkpoint/GPU (vLLM 0.22,
`enable_prefix_caching=True`, base, prefix + 24-token suffix), vLLM saves a
comparable fraction of TTFT on a cached prefix:

| shared prefix | vLLM cold | vLLM APC reuse | vLLM saved |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2048 | 481 ms | 143 ms | 70% |
| 4096 | 549 ms | 76 ms | 86% |
| 8192 | 1076 ms | 120 ms | 89% |

So we do **not** claim a better prefix-reuse *mechanism*. What is actually
different here:

- **Lower absolute latency** from full-graph CUDA-graph replay + hand-tuned
  NVFP4 kernels (the cold prefill above is ~1.4-1.9x faster than vLLM's; clean
  same-method single-stream TTFT is ~1.5-1.9x and decode with MTP ~2x — see the
  decode-kernel docs). The *reuse ratio* is comparable; the *floor* is lower.
- **Capsule is an explicit, host-controlled, bit-exact primitive**
  (`snapshot` / `restore` / `fork` / restore-to-an-earlier-checkpoint), not an
  implicit block pool — it lets the host fork one prefill into N branches and
  roll a session back to a committed boundary deterministically.
- **One mechanism across LLM + VLA + robot** under the same execution contract
  (vLLM/SGLang are LLM-only); the robot side uses the identical Buffer
  snapshot/restore (`serving/robot_recap`, cosine 1.0).

In short: for high-concurrency multi-tenant LLM serving, the paged/radix engines
lead; FlashRT's target is latency-first single/few-session work on consumer/edge
hardware, hybrid models, and cross-domain (LLM/VLA/robot) — where the lower
latency floor + the bit-exact cross-domain capsule are the real edge, not prefix
reuse per se.

**Decode throughput is unchanged by either feature** (they touch prefill / TTFT
only): warm steady-state matches the frontend's documented decode number; the
serving policy adds no measurable decode overhead.

**3. Decode is stable across task types** (real `/v1/chat/completions`,
median of 3 runs in the fixed-shape warmed benchmark mode):

| scenario | ctx | fixed-shape decode tok/s |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| code (merge sort) | 20 | 159.0 |
| reasoning (bat & ball) | 41 | 150.3 |
| code (two-sum) | 26 | 138.2 |
| math (word problem) | 38 | 128.9 |
| chat (explain) | 23 | 119.8 |
| long generation (512 tok) | 22 | 115.9 |
| doc-QA / RAG | 3023 | 90.6 |

Run-to-run variance < 2%. Decode tok/s varies with the task's speculative
accept-length (predictable code/reasoning highest; long-context attention pulls
the 3K-context RAG case down) — not with the serving path. These rows are the
fixed-shape warmed graph-replay benchmark mode, not the production agent
default.

To reproduce these rows, keep the same serving envelope and measurement
discipline:

```bash
export FLASHRT_QWEN36_MTP_CKPT_DIR=/path/to/qwen36_mtp_ckpt
export FLASHRT_QWEN36_LONG_KV_CACHE=fp8
export FLASHRT_QWEN36_TQ_VERIFY_GRAPH=1
export FLASHRT_QWEN36_TQ_MTP_CHAIN_GRAPH=1
python -m serving.qwen36_agent.server \
  --checkpoint /path/to/qwen36_nvfp4 \
  --max-seq 32768 \
  --route-min-seq 0 \
  --warmup-preset agent \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The production agent path should be measured without those graph flags: it uses
direct verify/MTP-chain kernel launch, so an arbitrary new prompt length no
longer falls to cold graph-capture throughput. On RTX 5090, first-use live
requests measured ~122 tok/s for a short text stream and ~130 tok/s for a
tool-shaped stream with K=6.

## Automatic prefix reuse (walkthrough)

Resend the full message list across turns, including the previous assistant
turn. This is the normal OpenAI-compatible client pattern. The server tokenizes
the new prompt, finds the longest exact token-prefix match against the hot
state, and prefills only the appended suffix:

```bash
# turn 1 (cold): flashrt.cached_tokens == 0
curl -s :8000/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"qwen36-27b",
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"List three sorting algorithms."}],"max_tokens":128}'

# turn 2 (warm): append the prior assistant reply + a new user message;
# flashrt.cached_tokens > 0, prefix_action == "append" / "message_append"
curl -s :8000/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"qwen36-27b",
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"List three sorting algorithms."},
             {"role":"assistant","content":"<prior reply>"},
             {"role":"user","content":"Now give the time complexity of each."}],"max_tokens":128}'
```

If a client sends only the new message without the prior assistant turn, or a
shorter/divergent prompt, the token stream has diverged and the server rebuilds
or restores at a checkpoint boundary (it reports `rebuild`, never a fake hit).

## Capsule pinning (shared-prefix reuse for non-hot requests)

A coding agent often resends a large stable prefix — system prompt, tool
schemas, repo index/summary — plus a small user/tool/diff suffix. The normal
single hot conversation uses automatic `append` / `message_append`. Capsules are
for the cases that hot-state append cannot cover: fresh sessions, branch/fork,
restart/resume, non-hot workers, or a deliberately pinned shared prefix reused by
multiple later requests. A capsule restores a clean committed boundary and
re-prefills only the suffix. This is FlashRT's graph-replay-native prefix reuse
(see [`capsules.md`](capsules.md) and [`../../docs/serving_design.md`](../../docs/serving_design.md)).

Enable it at startup with a GPU byte budget, then pin per request:

```bash
python -m serving.qwen36_agent.server --checkpoint /path/to/qwen36_nvfp4 \
  --max-seq 32768 --route-min-seq 0 --capsule-budget-mb 4096
```

```bash
# First turn: pin the stable prefix (e.g. its first 6000 tokens). The server
# cold-prefills + snapshots a chunk-aligned capsule, then serves normally.
curl -s :8000/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"qwen36-27b",
 "messages":[{"role":"system","content":"<system + tool schemas + repo index>"},
             {"role":"user","content":"First task"}],
 "flashrt_pin_prefix": 6000, "max_tokens": 256}'
# -> flashrt.prefix_action == "pin"

# Later turns / fresh sessions that share that prefix: restore + suffix only.
curl -s :8000/v1/chat/completions -d '{"model":"qwen36-27b",
 "messages":[{"role":"system","content":"<same system + tools + repo index>"},
             {"role":"user","content":"Second task"}],
 "flashrt_pin_prefix": 6000, "max_tokens": 256}'
# -> flashrt.prefix_action == "restore", cached_tokens == the chunk-aligned
#    boundary, new_prefill_tokens == only the suffix after it
```

Semantics and bounds:

- `flashrt_pin_prefix` is an int (pin that many leading prompt tokens) or `true`
  (pin the whole prompt's aligned head). The pin boundary is floored to the long
  prefill chunk size (2048), so a prefix shorter than one chunk is not pinned.
- A capsule is keyed by the digest of its chunk-aligned prefix tokens, so any
  later request — same session or not — whose prompt starts with that exact prefix
  restores it. Restore is **token-identical to a cold full prefill** (gated by
  `tests/test_qwen36_agent_capsule_serving.py`); tool conversations benefit too,
  because the stable system+tools head is pinned and only the changing suffix is
  re-prefilled.
- `--capsule-budget-mb` bounds GPU footprint. Capsules are LRU-evicted to fit and
  a single capsule larger than the whole budget is rejected (the request is served
  cold — never an OOM, never a false hit). Each capsule's KV grows with the pin
  length (≈230 MB for a 4096-token aligned prefix here), and competes with the
  model + KV cache for VRAM, so size the budget to the headroom you have.
- `/health` reports `capsules` (count, bytes, budget). Default budget is `0`
  (pinning off, serving path byte-identical).

## Validation

Fast policy and HTTP checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest -q \
  tests/test_qwen36_agent_serving_policy.py \
  tests/test_qwen36_server_warmup.py \
  tests/test_qwen36_agent_gpu_split.py
```

The GPU split test is skipped unless both checkpoint variables are present.  To
validate real Qwen3.6 short/long split and long append equivalence:

```bash
FLASHRT_QWEN36_NVFP4_CKPT_DIR=CHECKPOINT_DIR \
FLASHRT_QWEN36_MTP_CKPT_DIR=MTP_CHECKPOINT_DIR \
PYTHONPATH=. PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 \
pytest -q tests/test_qwen36_agent_gpu_split.py \
  tests/test_qwen36_agent_capsule.py \
  tests/test_qwen36_agent_capsule_serving.py -s
```

`test_qwen36_agent_capsule_serving.py` gates the serving-layer pin/restore policy:
a restored pinned prefix produces the same tokens as a cold full prefill.
