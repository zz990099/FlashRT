# serving/qwen36_agent

Production-oriented Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4 serving example for long-running agent
sessions.

This directory is the **policy layer** above the FlashRT execution contract. It
owns session cache, exact token-prefix reuse, OpenAI-compatible tool calling,
streaming, and request scheduling. It must not add session or KV verbs to
`exec/`; the contract remains Buffer / Graph / Plan / Event / ShapeKey.

## Design target

- 256K context on the existing Qwen3.6 long-context FP8-KV/TQ kernel path.
- Latency-first, single-stream hot session by default.
- Exact token-prefix reuse for coding-agent turns: cold prefill once, then only
  prefill appended user/tool/diff/log tokens.
- Startup committed-stream warmup so the first real request does not pay
  CUDA Graph capture for common agent prompt shapes.
- True SSE streaming at speculative-decode accept boundaries.
- Streamed tokens are session-committed tokens only. The old stateless
  full-generate shortcut of over-verifying and trimming output is forbidden in
  this host because it would leave hidden KV state ahead of the client-visible
  transcript.
- OpenAI-compatible tool calls without leaking partial `<tool_call>` JSON.
- Interfaces that can later grow into paged/offloaded KV, batched decode, or
  multi-GPU routing without changing the `exec` contract.

## v1 cache policy

The first backend is contiguous and session-first because that matches the
current fastest Qwen3.6 CUDA-graph replay path. A request can reuse the hot
frontend state when its tokenized prompt exactly extends the cached session
prefix.

For OpenAI-style clients that resend full visible history, the service also
tracks the visible message journal. If the token journal contains hidden
Qwen-only tokens that the client does not resend, the service recognizes the
message-list append and prefills only the serialized suffix after the previous
assistant turn. Divergent prompts rebuild or restore at a future checkpoint
boundary. Truncation also rebuilds in v1: the frontend cannot roll the hot GPU
state back to a shorter prefix until checkpoint/rollback support lands.

For OpenAI-style clients that resend the full message list every turn, prefix
reuse requires the history to include the assistant content/tool call emitted by
the previous response. If a client sends only the new user/tool message without
the assistant turn, the token stream has diverged and the server must rebuild or
restore from a checkpoint.

This intentionally differs from paged/block serving frameworks: those are good
for high-concurrency batch serving, but the first FlashRT agent target is one
interactive long session on a consumer GPU.

## Implementation phases

1. CPU-only meta validation for prefix planning and tool-call streaming.
2. Split Qwen3.6 frontend generation into prefill and spec-decode steps.
3. Add the FastAPI host that maps OpenAI requests to session-aware generation.
4. Add checkpoint/rollback and eviction policy.
5. Benchmark: cold 128K/200K/256K plus incremental 2K/8K/16K turns.

## Current backend gate

`Qwen36FrontendAgentEngine` is wired to the real Qwen3.6 frontend for the
short-context committed split:

- cold short prefill: `prefill_own_speculative_nvfp4_agent`
- hot contiguous short append: `append_own_speculative_nvfp4_agent`
- cold long prefill: `prefill_long_ctx_nvfp4_agent`
- hot contiguous long append: `append_long_ctx_nvfp4_agent`
- committed streaming decode:
  `decode_own_speculative_nvfp4_committed_stream` or
  `decode_long_ctx_nvfp4_committed_stream`

Long-context append-prefill is limited to the currently hot contiguous session.
Non-hot sessions still rebuild/restore at the policy layer rather than reporting
a fake cache hit.
Exact same-length prompts continue from the current hot boundary; shorter
prompts rebuild until rollback/checkpoint support lands.

## Run

```bash
python -m serving.qwen36_agent.server \
  --checkpoint CHECKPOINT_DIR \
  --model-name qwen36-27b \
  --max-seq 262208 \
  --route-min-seq 0 \
  --graph-cache-max 128 \
  --warmup-preset agent \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8000
```

The agent host defaults to `--route-min-seq 0`, which sends short real prompts
through the chunked long-context FP8-KV path instead of the older per-position
short route. This avoids request-time graph capture for arbitrary short prompt
lengths. Startup warmup runs real committed-stream warmup for short/medium
shapes and graph-only warmup for larger long-context shapes.

Warmup controls:

- `--warmup-preset agent|short|long|all|none`
- `--warmup "prompt_len:max_tokens,..."`
- `--warmup-committed-max-prompt N`
- `--warm-long-prefill-graphs`

The HTTP surface is OpenAI-compatible for `/v1/models` and
`/v1/chat/completions`.  FlashRT-specific request fields are:

- `flashrt_session_id`: stable session key for prefix reuse.
- `flashrt_cache_salt`: optional namespace separator for different prompt
  policies.
- `flashrt_K`: speculative decode K for this request.
- `enable_thinking`: passed to the Qwen chat template.

## Validation

Fast policy and HTTP checks:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest -q \
  tests/test_qwen36_agent_serving_policy.py \
  tests/test_qwen36_server_warmup.py \
  tests/test_qwen36_agent_gpu_split.py
```

The GPU split test is skipped unless both checkpoint variables are present.  To
validate real Qwen3.6 short/long split and long append equivalence:

```bash
FLASHRT_QWEN36_NVFP4_CKPT_DIR=CHECKPOINT_DIR \
FLASHRT_QWEN36_MTP_CKPT_DIR=MTP_CHECKPOINT_DIR \
PYTHONPATH=. PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 \
pytest -q tests/test_qwen36_agent_gpu_split.py -s
```
